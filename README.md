# MADS Capstone project: A Clinical Trials ChatBot that Speaks Your Language

### SIADS 699 - Capstone (Winter 2024)

Team RAGtime BAND (team 7):
- Douglas Bailey (dbailey@umich.edu)
- Dmitry Danilov (ddanilov@umich.edu)
- Parker Moesta (parkermo@umich.edu)

## Overview

Based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our ChatBot allows users to interact and receive high-quality, plain language information derived
from this reliable source. This approach allows users to extract meaning from complex information.

## Project repository structure

- [Research and Development](development/README.md) - A Jupyter notebook we used for numerous experiments, evaluations, collection of metrics and basic development of the application code
- [Server](app-server/README.md) - The back-end module of our system. Implemented with the FastAPI framework.
- [UI](app-ui/README.md) - The front-end module of our system. Implemented using the Streamlit library.
